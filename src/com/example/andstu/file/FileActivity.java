	 * 
	 * Storage Options  
	 * from http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html
	 * ==============================================
	 * Using the Internal Storage
	 * You can save files directly on the device's internal storage. 
	 * By default, files saved to the internal storage are private to your application and other applications cannot access them (nor can the user). 
	 * When the user uninstalls your application, these files are removed.
	 * 
	 * Tip: 
	 * If you want to save a static file in your application at compile time, 
	 * save the file in your project res/raw/ directory. 
	 * You can open it with openRawResource(), 
	 * passing the R.raw.<filename> resource ID. 
	 * This method returns an InputStream that you can use to read the file (but you cannot write to the original file).
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Saving cache files 
	 * If you'd like to cache some data, 
	 * rather than store it persistently, 
	 * you should use getCacheDir() to open a File that represents the internal directory where your application should save temporary cache files.
	 * When the device is low on internal storage space,
	 * Android may delete these cache files to recover space. 
	 * However, you should not rely on the system to clean up these files for you. 
	 * You should always maintain the cache files yourself and stay within a reasonable limit of space consumed, 
	 * such as 1MB. When the user uninstalls your application, these files are removed.
	 * 
	 * ==============================================
	 * Using the External Storage
	 * Every Android-compatible device supports a shared "external storage" that you can use to save files. 
	 * This can be a removable storage media (such as an SD card) or an internal (non-removable) storage. 
	 * Files saved to the external storage are world-readable and can be modified by the user when they enable USB mass storage to transfer files on a computer.
	 * 
	 * Caution: 
	 * External storage can become unavailable if the user mounts the external storage on a computer or removes the media, 
	 * and there's no security enforced upon files you save to the external storage. 
	 * All applications can read and write files placed on the external storage and the user can remove them.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Saving files that can be shared with other apps
     * To get a File representing the appropriate public directory, 
	 * call getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(), 
	 * passing it the type of directory you want, 
	 * such as DIRECTORY_MUSIC, DIRECTORY_PICTURES, DIRECTORY_RINGTONES, or others. 
	 * By saving your files to the corresponding media-type directory, 
	 * the system's media scanner can properly categorize your files in the system 
	 * (for instance, ringtones appear in system settings as ringtones, not as music).
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Saving files that are app-private
	 * If you are handling files that are not intended for other apps to use (such as graphic textures or sound effects used by only your app), 
	 * you should use a private storage directory on the external storage by calling getExternalFilesDir(). 
	 * This method also takes a type argument to specify the type of subdirectory (such as DIRECTORY_MOVIES). 
	 * If you don't need a specific media directory, 
	 * pass null to receive the root directory of your app's private directory.
	 * Beginning with Android 4.4, 
	 * reading or writing files in your app's private directories does not require the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE or WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions. 
	 * So you can declare the permission should be requested only on the lower versions of Android by adding the maxSdkVersion attribute:
	 *     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" android:maxSdkVersion="18" />
	 * Note: 
	 * When the user uninstalls your application, 
	 * this directory and all its contents are deleted. 
	 * Also, the system media scanner does not read files in these directories, 
	 * so they are not accessible from the MediaStore content provider. 
	 * As such, you should not use these directories for media that ultimately belongs to the user, 
	 * such as photos captured or edited with your app, 
	 * or music the user has purchased with your app―those files should be saved in the public directories.
	 * 
	 * Sometimes, a device that has allocated a partition of the internal memory for use as the external storage may also offer an SD card slot. 
	 * When such a device is running Android 4.3 and lower, 
	 * the getExternalFilesDir() method provides access to only the internal partition and your app cannot read or write to the SD card. 
	 * Beginning with Android 4.4, however, 
	 * you can access both locations by calling getExternalFilesDirs(), 
	 * which returns a File array with entries each location. 
	 * The first entry in the array is considered the primary external storage and you should use that location unless it's full or unavailable. 
	 * If you'd like to access both possible locations while also supporting Android 4.3 and lower, 
	 * use the support library's static method, ContextCompat.getExternalFilesDirs(). 
	 * This also returns a File array, 
	 * but always includes only one entry on Android 4.3 and lower.
	 * 
	 * Caution 
	 * Although the directories provided by getExternalFilesDir() and getExternalFilesDirs() are not accessible by the MediaStore content provider, 
	 * other apps with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can access all files on the external storage, 
	 * including these. 
	 * If you need to completely restrict access for your files, 
	 * you should instead write your files to the internal storage.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Saving cache files
	 * To open a File that represents the external storage directory where you should save cache files, 
	 * call getExternalCacheDir(). 
	 * If the user uninstalls your application, 
	 * these files will be automatically deleted.
	 * Similar to ContextCompat.getExternalFilesDirs(), 
	 * mentioned above, 
	 * you can also access a cache directory on a secondary external storage (if available) by calling ContextCompat.getExternalCacheDirs().
	 * 
	 * Tip: 
	 * To preserve file space and maintain your app's performance, 
	 * it's important that you carefully manage your cache files and remove those that aren't needed anymore throughout your app's lifecycle.
